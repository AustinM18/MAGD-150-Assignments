# MAGD-150 Assignment

## Readme File
Enclosed in this repository are examples of code for MAGD 150 at UW-W



## Example 1

[Black and White Example](https://github.com/AustinM18/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/AssignmentOne.pde)

For this lab we had to use **simple shapes** along with only **grayscale colors** in order to come up with a simple drawing to meet our requirements. For this lab our theme was outer space so I created a moon with a flag on it, stars surrounding the moon, and a spaceship to the right of the moon. I used different varients of shapes with different aspects of fill and stroke to meet my goals. 

## Example 2
[Color Composition Example](https://github.com/AustinM18/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/AssignmentTwo.pde)

For this lab we had to use **simple shapes** but this this time we were introduced to the different aspects of **color** such as _rgb_, _hex_, and _cymk_ colors. For this assignment our theme was balloons, so I created three hot air balloons of differrent colors that had different shapes as the baskets. For the baskets I created a _trapizoid_, _triangle_, and _beginShape_. 

## Example 3
[Math Operations Example](https://github.com/AustinM18/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/AssignmentThree.pde)

For this lab we had to use certain **processing keywords**, **math operators**, and **trigonomotry words**. For this assignment our theme was screensavers, so I created the background with simple shapes with monochromatic blues. I then used the _math operators_ and _trigonomotry keywords_ to create a square shape that moves back and forth across the screen at a relatively slow pace. I also made it so when the squares were to hit the border of the screen, it would change directions and go back the other way. I also used _mouse pressed_ keywords to allow the user to click the screen and decide where they want to square to be placed. I also used _key pressed_ to allow the user to manually change the direction of the square. 

## Example 4
[Dynamism Example](https://github.com/AustinM18/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/AssignmentFour.pde)

For this lab we had to use **key pressed**, **mouse pressed**, and **for or while loops**. For this assignment our theme was pizza so I created a circular pizza that had a slice of pizza moving in and out. I then used the _key pressed_ keyword to have the color change on the pizza so it would go from red marinara sauce to white fettucini sauce. I also used the _mouse pressed_ keyword to have the color change on the topping to go from red pepperoni to black olives. Finally, I then used a for loop to create lines going down the pizza a set amount of times to make green peppers.

## Example 5
[Organization Example](https://github.com/AustinM18/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/AssignmentFive.pde)

For this lab we had to use **functions** and **classes** to make our code organized and neat. For this assignment our theme was weather so I created a bunch of different colored clouds with rain coming out of them. One of the ways that I used _functions_ was to create a void function that I called in draw that would create all of the clouds. I also created two more _functions_ in the _class_ that I created to simulate the rain. I also made it so that rain drops would all fall at a random location above the image along with random speeds. Once the raindrop would go out of bounds at the bottom it would get reset back up to the top of the image so the rain could continue to fall.
